# File-Creator
Windows Forms utility for creating files based on name, extension, and file path. This is a development tool I created while working on my CS degree when I was making .java files every
other day. Since then, I've expanded it and added a boilerplate code option for supported extensions (HTML, XML, etc.) and file groups (HTML+CSS+JS). There is also a default option to attempt to automatically open new files in whatever default program is set for their extension in Windows.
This is a simple tool but a powerful one for rapidly creating files.



Supported file extensions: C, CS, CSS, DOCX, HTML, JAVA, JS, PHP, PPTX, XML

The app will allow you to manually enter any extension and attempt to create the file. Usually the creation itself works, but some file types (like PDFs) will be missing required formatting and will likely be unusable.

I will be regularly expanding boilerplate, file group, and file extension support. Feel free to request any new features. This project is part of my portfolio so I appreciate any support I can get!
